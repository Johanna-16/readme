Created on: April 4, 2025 <br />
Contact: Johanna Liu

## Softwares
Modules: load_data, sort, text_UI, batch_UI
Functions: histogram, curve_fit

Version: 1.0

## Description
File of all the projects completed using techniques learned in ECOR 1042. Skills include sorting (selection/ bubble/insertion), creating the user interface, converting data into dictionaries, and plotting graphs.

## Dependencies
* If the file is not noted, it has no dependencies

Python libraries used for histogram -> <br />
matplotlib.pyplot as plt <br />
math

Python libraries used for curve_fit -> <br />
numpy

Created libraries used for batch_UI -> <br />
load_data as LD <br />
sort as Sort <br />
curve_fit as CF <br />
histogram as Hist

Created libraries used for text_UI -> <br />
curve_fit as cf <br />
histogram as hist

## Installation
Python version 3.10 and newer is required for all programs.

Python version used: Python 3.13.2

#### 1. Download the files <br />
Download the preferred files from Brightspace
#### 2. Extract the files <br />

#### 4. Install Required Dependencies <br />
** Please check the dependencies section for more information about the dependencies of each file <br />
Download the additional files needed for the program and/or install all the required packages.

To download Matplotlib and NumPy, refer to the file "Installing Matplotlib, Numpy and Scipy" in the ECOR 1042 Brightspace under "Lectures".

#### 5. Use the code! <br />
You should now be able to use the modules or functions. Try to use the 'import' command in your code!

Example. Importing the load_data module and referring to it as LD
```python
import load_data as LD
```
